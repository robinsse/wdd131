            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath
                commanded, for I
                know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them
                that they may
                accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

            <p>And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and
                the
                power of
                the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be
                saved
                in the
                everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of great joy, how beautiful
                upon the
                mountains shall they be.</p>

                Zion;
                and
                strengthen thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more be confounded, that the
                covenants of the
                Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled.</p>
