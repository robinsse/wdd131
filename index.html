                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="Profile pic">
                <p>My name is Selena Robins. I am an academic support administrator studying Software Development at
                    BYU-Pathway Worldwide. My career objective is to develop scalable systems that support greater
                    efficiency, transparency, and
                    collaboration across different groups in higher education.</p>
                <p>I have successfully helped develop a new grading system that handles thousands of submissions across
                    three institutions
                    of higher learning. I also recently developed a multi-language system to handle course maintenance
                    tickets, creating
                    automated flows to improve accountability and reporting across multiple programs.
                    I am known for my innovative mindset, and my ability to address complex business processes with
                    simple
                    technical
                    solutions.</p>
                <p>I was born in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada to a Filipino mother and a Dutch father. I
                    am married and have five children, 4 boys and 1 girl. My oldest son is married and my daughter is on
                    a
                    mission in Kentucky speaking Spanish. The
                    other three boys are at home. In my spare time I like to
                    spend time with my family and watch movies.</p>

                <p>I served in the Romania Bucharest Mission from 2000-2001 under President and Sora Jarvis. I was
                    assigned
                    to three areas during my mission: Bacau, Cluj-Napoca, and Bucharest Sector 4. </p>
