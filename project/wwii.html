        <h2>WWII</h2>
        <h3>Start of the War</h3>
        <p>In 1940, a World-Championship in Milan Italy was half on its way. The rumors about a second World War
            disturbed many of
            the athletes and they quit. We were advised to leave Italy on account that Germany was mobilizing on the
            borders towards France and Poland.</p>

        <p>There were two ways to get back to Holland. The Dutch team went via Switzerland, France, Belgium into Holland
            passing 3
            border crossings. I decided to go via Switzerland, Germany to Holland—only 2 border crossings. I did make
            the right
            choice. In fact I was one week earlier home in Holland than those crossing the 3 borders.</p>

        <p>Indeed Germany invaded Poland, and everyone was alert of the things that would follow. Then, on the 10th of
            May 1940, we
            awoke about 4 a.m. in the morning through a dreadful noise of hundreds of planes flying and shooting low
            over the
            houses.</p>

        <p>We all realized it was war. Soon thereafter, there were motorcycles and small type cars with armed German
            soldiers
            coming from the riverside. Apparently they were secretly shipped in long cargo barges down the river “Maas”
            the night
            before the invasion direct from Germany.</p>

        <p>In other words, we were instantly occupied by the Germans. The only resistance the Germans had was at the
            “Maas-bridge.”
            They just could not get over the river, as the Dutch Marine Corps were determined to hold their position.
            An ultimatum was sent to them by the German forces, “Surrender or we will bomb Rotterdam.” The Dutch Marine
            Corps held
            their position with stubbornness. Consequently, the Germans went ahead and bombed the center of Rotterdam
            completely
            flat on the fifth day of combat.</p>

        <h3>The Bombing of Rotterdam</h3>

        <p>We were living in the south of Rotterdam, back over the river from where the occupation took direct place.
            Within a few
            hours—without any casualties lucky enough—we all witnessed the total bombing of Rotterdam Center. (In this
            area was the
            store that I just finished renovating.)</p>

        <p>It was said more than 40,000 people did not survive the bombing. It was a terrible sight. The odor of the
            dead burnt
            bodies and the smoking of the ruins were for months hanging over in the city.</p>

        <p>It was amazing that merchants started clearing and cleaning the spot they once were located with their store
            in order to
            have a temporary erected store to serve the public. It was usual to chip away the mortar from the old bricks
            and use it
            to construct walls together with unburned old wooden beams and slates if any, as new material was very
            scarce to
            purchase.</p>

        <p>For some stores, it was impossible to build a temporal emergency store. They made large signs on the spot
            where once the
            store was, to inform the public that they moved their store to an emergency area district on the outskirts
            of Rotterdam.
            In fact, in a short time, we were known to be the only company that could serve all aspects and their wants
            to start
            getting them back on their feet again.
            This was, for my new company, great business. We were busy all over the town. We employed a number of people
            to serve
            our clients. Ironically, the German authority did not interfere with the work we were doing up to 1943. They
            started to
            transfer men to Germany to work in factories in the beginning. Later on, they needed the men for building
            defenses and
            shelters in Germany.</p>

        <p>That was the time we had to hide if you did not want to get arrested. Then came the forced “Razia.” Early one
            morning in
            1944, German troops barricaded the street corners in south Rotterdam where I had my studio work place. A
            loud speaker
            told the public that all men young and old should come out of their homes and gather themselves at the
            square called
            “Africander Plein” that was located at the end of the street of Cathy's home.</p>

        <h3>Into Hiding</h3>

        <p>Let me tell first that I had in the beginning of the war, my studio completely closed-in with plywood
            paneling to
            protect the windows from possible bomb-shells, so the outside looked like a closed warehouse. At the back of
            the
            warehouse, I had an area with a double ceiling, that could be used for a hiding place if needed.
            That morning when the Razia started, I happened to be staying overnight at Cathy's mother's home. That was
            just around
            the corner from my studio. Since every night it was curfew as soon as the sun went under, it was more
            convenient
            sometimes to stay overnight rather than being alone in my studio.</p>

        <p>In order to explain where Cathy's mother's house was located as to my studio: try to imagine a row of houses
            making a
            square configuration as a block. Each row of houses had its own street name, so there are streets that form
            the block.
            In fact, one can walk around the block.</p>

        <p>Let's say my studio is located in street Nr. 1. Coming out of my studio and going to my right around the
            corner, I would
            be on street Nr.2, where Cathy's mother's house is. If I would continue to the end of Cathy's street and
            turn right on
            that corner I would be on street Nr.3. If I would continue on Nr. 3 street to the end and turn right on that
            street and
            turn right again, one would be on street Nr. 1 where my studio was.</p>

        <p>I thought it would give you the correct idea how I got around the entire block before I could get back to my
            studio to
            escape the German Razia.</p>

        <p>I had told Cathy that I would try to get to my studio and asked her to go the next day to the studio and
            knock with a
            certain code to see if I did succeed to get into my studio that morning. So, I went downstairs and walked
            straight to one of the German soldiers on watch and asked him (in German) what was
            going on this morning. So he said that all men had to gather at the square. The square was opposite Nr. 3
            street. (Of
            course I did know, as it was announced by the loud speaker.) I was buying time.</p>

        <p>I asked if I could go back to get some warm clothes. He said that I could not go back, so I started walking
            towards
            street Nr. 3 and I again asked the same question to the second soldier. Surprisingly he said, “Get going,
            hurry up.” So
            I more or less ran to the next corner and told the third soldier that I had the ok to go and pick up my
            clothes. So now
            I was on Street Nr. 4. I had one more corner to go to get on my studio's street. Before I reached the last
            corner to my
            studio, I walked up to two soldiers standing there. I told them I was going to pick up my clothing around
            the corner and
            would go down to the square where all men had to be gathered. So instead of asking, I told them what I was
            going to do.
            It worked! I ran around the corner and unlocked my door and bolted it in the inside. Strangely enough, I
            heard only some
            rattling on the door, like someone was trying if the door was locked.</p>

        <p>I am sure that no one saw me going into the studio. As I mentioned before, the premises looked like it was a
            warehouse,
            even like it was vacant. I really do not know who was rattling on the door about a 1/2 hour after I had
            locked it. It is
            obvious none of the soldiers knew where I was. When I ran around the corner, I almost vanished, as each
            individual
            entrance was somewhat hidden from the street and they all looked alike.</p>

        <p>The next day Cathy very cautiously knocked our code on the studio door and was happy that I managed to avoid
            being taken
            away. It was about 2 weeks before Cathy went to find out if our friends in the underground also escaped the
            Razia. She
            was told to tell me to go during the curfew to a certain place about 15 minutes on the bike from where I
            was. Someone
            would be there to take me to their hiding place.</p>

        <h3>The Underground</h3>

        <p>I waited for a moonless night and joined our friends with great pleasure. Our hiding place was below the
            basement of a department store. Apparently, it was a vault built especially for fur-coats
            during the summer season.</p>

        <p>I was one of them who was assigned to take care of getting food from the farmers. Money had no value. Since
            our Jan de
            Jong was the owner of the store, he had all kinds of valuable merchandise to be exchanged for food with the
            friendly
            farmers.</p>

        <p>Only during curfew, when there was no moon, was it possible to go hunting for food. Ironically, we found the
            safest way
            to travel without being seen. As this was the best time for the German troops to relocate their positions,
            we never were
            discovered following them, because it was sometimes pitch-dark and we could hardly see each other to be
            identified.</p>

        <p>We simply followed them in the same direction they went. The greatest problem was, however, that we could not
            cross the
            river over the bridges. We had hidden rowboats in high reed straw rotting away from the bridges because they
            were well
            guarded by the soldiers. These rowboats were owned by farmers. Sometimes it would take hours before we got
            picked up to
            cross the river due to waiting for the right time. Even more so to get back over the river again bringing
            all the food
            we had exchanged for merchandise.</p>

        <p>We brought all kinds of food back with us. Sometimes we tied a half of a pig on our backs for easy transport.
            In fact,
            we brought anything that was eatable—pieces of meat, potatoes, corn, vegetables of all kinds. This was the
            only way we
            could survive. We were privileged in compromising with many unfortunate people that were starving.</p>

        <h3>Marrige Attempt</h3>

        <p>Apparently, it seemed that the Germans were intending to blow-up all harbors in Rotterdam to leave everything
            destroyed
            as much as possible. It was a sign for us that they were pulling back from their positions—thereby paying
            less attention
            to their strict orders from their superiors. We started feeling ourselves getting freed from the constant
            pressure.
            Cathy and I were very naïve as we went to city hall to get registered for our marriage. The clerk looked at
            us and asked
            us to wait, went to his desk and after he spoke on the phone, he asked us to follow him. We went through the
            back
            downstairs in the building, through long corridors, until we came into a different department that seemed to
            be the
            police offices known as the “Haagse-veer” in Rotterdam. Actually they were just normal Dutchmen who were
            supervised by
            the German authority.</p>

        <p>We were brought into an office room. We were very blessed that the chief inspector for alliance happened to
            be an old
            friend of my father. We knew him as Mr. Roos because for many years my dad did freelance work for him as
            interpreter in
            court or other troubled cases with the Chinese.
            He was surprised that we did not know that it was the law to forbid a non-Arian to be married with an Arian.
            (“Hitler’s
            law”) He told us to get away and not to tell others what we were planning to do. We could be arrested and
            sent to a
            concentration camp. You can understand how grateful we were to be protected by Inspector Roos who warned us
            to avoid
            getting into great danger.</p>

        <h3>End of the War</h3>

        <p>Approximately a year later, there were only a few military Germans in our area. They were confiscating
            everything that
            had wheels, even baby carriages. They needed them to put their beer in to pull back over the German borders.
            It was a
            very laughable sight, seeing them pushing fully loaded carriages in contrast to how they came in 1940—with
            super tanks
            and modern motorized equipment.</p>

        <p>Now again Cathy and I went to city hall and indeed we did get married on our bikes with real tires that we
            had saved
            during the war. Of course there were no further transportation vehicles. Our family was compelled to walk
            around the
            bridges to city hall to witness our marriage. When we left city hall across the square, we very sadly saw 9
            people shot
            by the Germans. They were picked by random because one of the German officers was killed by the Dutch
            Underground
            Organization.</p>

        <p>Very short days thereafter, American bombers came from Sweden and dropped beautiful Swedish white bread to
            the hungry
            people. This was a sight that we all will never forget. The fact that Holland is full of lakes, rivers and
            canals, some
            people were not hesitant to jump in the cold water to obtain it. It is impossible to interpret the joy. It
            saved the
            population. It brought the sign that it was all over.</p>

        <p>After a few weeks, we had the sensation that the Canadians broke through into Holland with loud cheers and
            shooting
            jubilation. Seeing our liberators riding in our streets with their tanks, jeeps, and trucks, tears ran down
            faces by
            everyone there—an emotional sight.</p>

        <p>The soldiers were kissed and hugged. Chocolate and cigarettes were abundantly shared by the troops to the
            public. Many
            had forgotten how it tasted before. We all kept celebrating until we were dead tired—an unforgettable period
            for the
            people that suffered for 5 long years under hardship and pressure during the German occupation.</p>
