        <h2>About Howard Wing</h2>
        <h3>Childhood</h3>

        <p>I must have been about four years of age that I can vague remember that I live with my parents and sister
            Vera in
            Holland across the river called “Over de Ei” in Amsterdam.</p>

        <p>I remember that my sister had a large toy dog that she could sit on and it had wheels under the paws and a
            trigger on
            part of its neck that as it was pulled it barked.</p>

        <p>I had all kinds of toys, and a Nr. 1 Mecano set. The parts were spread all over the house including the
            balcony. In fact
            I was too small to have such a precious toy. As I remember, I made a type of bow and arrow and started
            shooting the
            parts away over the balcony. When I became older I started being more cautious, carefully storing the parts
            away after
            playing with it. (Later dates I kept getting additional follow-up boxes up to Nr. 5 Box.)</p>

        <p>After moving to England, I can remember living near the tower of London as I climbed often up on a wall
            separating the
            pavement from the tower area. It was about four feet high and about three feet wide—as far as I can
            remember. Once I
            fell off the wall on my back. I could hardly regain my breath. I learned a lesson and never climbed up that
            wall ever
            since.</p>

        <p>The Mindress 99 Algate London was quite a busy street where we lived on. My parents were told that I almost
            got run over
            by one of those large double-deck-busses that are typical in London. I was not aware that it happened to me.
        </p>

        <p>I was allowed to join the cub-scouts in London when I was about seven and went to the St. John Cas School. I
            won a
            drawing-contest and received a certificate with a box with color paint. I remember I drew a tiger.</p>

        <p>I had a friend Jeffery Street. His father was apparently a kind of superintendent of a large office building
            that had a
            flat roof and became our playground from time to time.</p>

        <p>I was given a small dog and one day it got loose and ran away over the tower bridge. I ran partially after
            it, but I
            gave up. He was too fast, so I lost my doggy and never saw him anymore.</p>

        <p>After living in London for more than three years, we all went back to Rotterdam, Holland. At school I was put
            back 2
            years in my class, as I could not speak Dutch. (In the same classroom where Cathy was, who at a later date
            became my
            wife in 1945.)</p>

        <p>After we passed our 6 Primary years in school, Cathy went to the ULO (Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs) for three
            years. And I
            went to the MULO (Meerder Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs) for four years.</p>
