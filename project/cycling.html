        <p>At the time we came back from England and my father had his boarding house in Atjehstraat Katendrecht
            Holland. There was a fish-and-chips store on the opposite side of the street. I became friendly with the son
            of the
            owner of the
            store. He had a real racing bicycle. So I was allowed to have my sister’s old bike to ride on when he was
            finished
            peeling potatoes for his father to be used in the evening.
            One day he, Beb, told me he had won a race in his club of the juniors and his brother-in-law would buy him a
            new racing
            bike. So his old bike was for sale for 10 guilders.
            It did not take much effort for me to convince my parents to buy it for me. So now I could join the club and
            become a junior race cyclist.</p>

            </picture>

            <p>You could see us always together on the race bikes after the potatoes were peeled.
                The first club race we had was a sprint, 300 meters from beginning to end. Believe it or not, I won and
                became junior
                sprint champion of our club “Fijenoord.” I seemed to have a natural acceleration at the start. Thereby,
                in
                the first 50
                meters, I would be three lengths ahead before they could catch up to me. I would still be more than one
                length ahead at
                the end of the 300 meter mark.</p>

            <p>This was not really good for my ego. I started training regularly and thought I could beat everyone.
                Well, I
                raced many
                long distance races and soon found out that to be a good contender, one must also go early to bed, rest
                well, eat and
                drink on time and keep concentrating on racing. However, with great pleasure and enjoyment, we had a
                wonderful time
                racing our bicycles in those years.</p>

            <p>I have a book with articles and photos that Cathy so diligently kept up to date during my cycling career.
                I
                accomplished
                to win 16 sprint championships in different sections of the country.</p>

            <p>Since the 1936 Olympics was coming up, I would be selected to be trained by the Dutch coach Mr. Gus
                Shilling
                (former
                world champion).</p>

            <p>However, it was discovered that I could not take part in the Olympic team on account that my nationality
                was
                Chinese
                rather than Dutch, despite the fact that I was born and raised in Holland.</p>

            <p>My Dutch license got revoked and all Dutch NWH racetracks were closed for me to race on.
                The Chinese ambassador Wunsz King, who had apparently heard of my dilemma, informed me that on his trip
                back
                to China,
                he would contact the Chinese Olympic committee in Shanghai. That is, if I would be willing to represent
                China in the
                Olympics as a cyclist.</p>
            <p>After waiting for a long time, I finally received a letter from the Chinese Olympic Committee to fill in
                the
                blank form
                and return it immediately back to Shanghai, China.</p>

            <p>Can you imagine? I think it was sent back the same day I received it. It did not take too long for them
                to
                send back the
                okay. I was in. Now it was up to me to put all my effort to do everything in my power to prove I was
                worth
                it to
                represent China.</p>

            <h3>1936 Berlin Olympics</h3>

                    width="400" height="200">
            </picture>

            <p>In my first heat, I had an Italian “Rola” (1935 world champion). It is very usual that a champion gets an
                unknown
                opponent in his first heat, but for me it was a great disadvantage. Rola beat me by a half-length. The
                time
                for the last
                300 meters was 13 seconds.</p>

            <p>In the retrial heat, I excelled too late in the last curve to pass my Canadian champion “Peace” and lost
                by
                30 c/m. [I
                raced] in a time that proved to be much too slow—15 seconds. For the last 200 meters, my tactics
                appeared to
                be not
                enough developed to ride against these experienced champions.</p>

            <p>I further received an invitation to participate in the World Championship in 1937 Amsterdam, in Zurich
                Switzerland 1938,
                and in Paris France 1939. I just could not get myself placed into the quarter finals in either of those
                events. I seem
                to be weak in my insight of tactics.</p>

            <p>I did not have any coaching. I was most of the time on my own and relied more on watching others—how they
                were taught to
                ride their races. Of course, one must have sprint abilities to be able to make 12 sec or less in the
                last
                200 meters,
                but not necessarily can he always become the winner, and can even lose a sprint in 16 sec.</p>

            <p>There is a tremendous lot of tactics involved. The greatest weapon one can have is to use your
                acceleration
                at the right
                moment by surprising the opponent either coming from behind him or accelerating down from the curve of
                the
                track when he
                leads his opponent in front.</p>

            <h3>1948 London Olympics</h3>

            <p>I started training again as I was eager to be selected again to represent China. Of course, there were no
                world
                championships or Olympics during the war. Unfortunately we missed 2 Olympics—1940 and 1944. So the 1948
                Olympics in
                London was facing us besides getting ready for the world championship in Zurich Switzerland in 1946.</p>

            <p>10th of June 1947: In that year I was again taking part in an international race in Zurich. During the
                race
                the public kept cheering every
                time I was passing them on the track. I had no idea why. When the race was over, I was told that they
                had
                received a
                call from Holland—that I had a boy son born. It was announced to the public by the loudspeaker. I do not
                know how I reacted, but I know I was laughing and crying the same time of joy.</p>

            <p>I have forgotten to mention that during the Olympics 1948 in London, England, members of each country
                team
                that could
                speak English were selected to be invited for a tea-party in Buckingham Palace London with the English
                Royal
                Family.</p>

            <p>When the athletes entered one by one into the large reception hall, a herald dressed in a beefeaters type
                outfit with a
                long staff in his hand made three knocks on the floor and, with a loud voice, he announced the name,
                country
                and type of
                sport we were participating in.</p>

            <p>The royal family and other dignitaries were in one line. So, each of us shook their hands. Sometimes
                questions were
                asked and answered by us. Even the Queen and the Prince of Holland were lined up. Prince Bernard spoke
                to me
                and said
                that he had been informed about my nationality problem I had in Holland, and wished me good luck with my
                cycling event.</p>
